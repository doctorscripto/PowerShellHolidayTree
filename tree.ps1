.SYNOPSIS
   This is a script that runs a Simple Holiday Tree
.DESCRIPTION
   This is a re-write and optimization of my first PowerShell script that
   creates a Holiday tree in the console complete with expensive
   blinking lights.  It serves no purpose other than to be
   pretty and as a demo of PowerShell
.EXAMPLE
   #Display Tree with default output for message
   .\tree.ps1 
.EXAMPLE
   #Display Tree with default output for message
   .\tree.ps1 -message 'Something fun to display'
.NOTES
   This is just a script to demo using Write-Host to extremes
   in PowerShell.  It serves no other purpose than to brighten
   up the console with blinking lights
.FUNCTIONALITY
   Completely frivolous and pointless fun
